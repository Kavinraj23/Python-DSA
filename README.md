# Python Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository contains implementations of various algorithms and data structures in Python. 

## Contents

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Implementations of common sorting techniques like Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort, and more.
- **Search Algorithms**: Various search algorithms including Binary Search, Linear Search, Depth-First Search (DFS), and Breadth-First Search (BFS).
- **Data Structures**: Implementations of essential data structures such as Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Hash Tables, and more.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Examples of dynamic programming problems and their solutions.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Solutions to problems using the greedy approach.
- **Divide and Conquer**: Examples of algorithms that use the divide-and-conquer strategy.

## How to Use

Each algorithm and data structure is implemented in a separate Python file with detailed comments explaining the logic and steps involved. You can clone this repository and run the scripts individually to understand their workings.
